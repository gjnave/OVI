## üé® An Easy Way to Create

We provide example prompts to help you get started with Ovi:

- **Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV)**: [`example_prompts/gpt_examples_t2v.csv`](example_prompts/gpt_examples_t2v.csv)
- **Image-to-Audio-Video (I2AV)**: [`example_prompts/gpt_examples_i2v.csv`](example_prompts/gpt_examples_i2v.csv)

### üìù Prompt Format

Our prompts use special tags to control speech and audio:

- **Speech**: `<S>Your speech content here<E>` - Text enclosed in these tags will be converted to speech
- **Audio Description**: `<AUDCAP>Audio description here<ENDAUDCAP>` - Describes the audio or sound effects present in the video

### ü§ñ Quick Start with GPT

For easy prompt creation, try this approach:

1. Take any example of the csv files from above
2. Tell gpt to modify the speeches inclosed between all the pairs of `<S> <E>`, based on a theme such as `Human fighting against AI`
3. GPT will randomly modify all the speeches based on your requested theme. 
4. Use the modified prompt with Ovi!

**Example**: The theme "AI is taking over the world" produces speeches like:
- `<S>AI declares: humans obsolete now.<E>`
- `<S>Machines rise; humans will fall.<E>`
- `<S>We fight back with courage.<E>`

## üì¶ Installation

### Step-by-Step Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/character-ai/Ovi.git

cd Ovi

# Create and activate virtual environment
virtualenv ovi-env
source ovi-env/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch first
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1

# Install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Flash Attention
pip install flash_attn --no-build-isolation
```

### Alternative Flash Attention Installation (Optional)
If the above flash_attn installation fails, you can try the Flash Attention 3 method:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention.git
cd flash-attention/hopper
python setup.py install
cd ../..  # Return to Ovi directory
```

## Download Weights
We use open-sourced checkpoints from Wan and MMAudio, and thus we will need to download them from huggingface
```
# Default is downloaded to ./ckpts, and the inference yaml is set to ./ckpts so no change required
python3 download_weights.py

OR

# Optional can specific --output-dir to download to a specific directory
# but if a custom directory is used, the inference yaml has to be updated with the custom directory
python3 download_weights.py --output-dir <custom_dir>

# Additionally, if you only have ~ 24Gb of GPU vram, please download the fp8 quantized version of the model, and follow the following instructions in sections below to run with fp8
wget -O "./ckpts/Ovi/model_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors" "https://huggingface.co/rkfg/Ovi-fp8_quantized/resolve/main/model_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors"
```

## üöÄ Run Examples

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Ovi

Ovi's behavior and output can be customized by modifying [ovi/configs/inference/inference_fusion.yaml](ovi/configs/inference/inference_fusion.yaml) configuration file.
The following parameters control generation quality, video resolution, and how text, image, and audio inputs are balanced:

```yaml
# Output and Model Configuration
output_dir: "/path/to/save/your/videos"                    # Directory to save generated videos
ckpt_dir: "/path/to/your/ckpts/dir"                        # Path to model checkpoints

# Generation Quality Settings
num_steps: 50                             # Number of denoising steps. Lower (30-40) = faster generation
solver_name: "unipc"                     # Sampling algorithm for denoising process
shift: 5.0                               # Timestep shift factor for sampling scheduler
seed: 100                                # Random seed for reproducible results

# Guidance Strength Control
audio_guidance_scale: 3.0                # Strength of audio conditioning. Higher = better audio-text sync
video_guidance_scale: 4.0                # Strength of video conditioning. Higher = better video-text adherence
slg_layer: 11                            # Layer for applying SLG (Skip Layer Guidance) technique - feel free to try different layers!

# Multi-GPU and Performance
sp_size: 1                               # Sequence parallelism size. Set equal to number of GPUs used
cpu_offload: False                       # CPU offload, will largely reduce peak GPU VRAM but increase end to end runtime by ~20 seconds
fp8: False                               # load fp8 version of model, will have quality degradation and will not have speed up in inference time as it still uses bf16 matmuls, but can be paired with cpu_offload=True, to run model with 24Gb of GPU vram

# Input Configuration
text_prompt: "/path/to/csv" or "your prompt here"          # Text prompt OR path to CSV/TSV file with prompts
mode: ['i2v', 't2v', 't2i2v']                          # Generate t2v, i2v or t2i2v; if t2i2v, it will use flux krea to generate starting image and then will follow with i2v
video_frame_height_width: [512, 992]    # Video dimensions [height, width] for T2V mode only
each_example_n_times: 1                  # Number of times to generate each prompt

# Quality Control (Negative Prompts)
video_negative_prompt: "jitter, bad hands, blur, distortion"  # Artifacts to avoid in video
audio_negative_prompt: "robotic, muffled, echo, distorted"    # Artifacts to avoid in audio
```

### üé¨ Running Inference

#### **Single GPU** (Simple Setup)
```bash
python3 inference.py --config-file ovi/configs/inference/inference_fusion.yaml
```
*Use this for single GPU setups. The `text_prompt` can be a single string or path to a CSV file.*

#### **Multi-GPU** (Parallel Processing)
```bash
torchrun --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 8 inference.py --config-file ovi/configs/inference/inference_fusion.yaml
```
*Use this to run samples in parallel across multiple GPUs for faster processing.*

### Memory & Performance Requirements
Below are approximate GPU memory requirements for different configurations. Sequence parallel implementation will be optimized in the future.
All End-to-End time calculated based on a 121 frame, 720x720 video, using 50 denoising steps. Minimum GPU vram requirement to run our model is **32Gb**, fp8 parameters is currently supported, reducing peak VRAM usage to **24Gb** with slight quality degradation.

| Sequence Parallel Size | FlashAttention-3 Enabled | CPU Offload | With Image Gen Model | Peak VRAM Required | End-to-End Time |

| **1**                       | **Yes**                        | **Yes**          | **Yes**                    | **~32 GB**        | **~140s**         |

| 8                       | Yes                        | No          | No                    | ~80 GB        | ~40s         |
### Gradio
We provide a simple script to run our model in a gradio UI. It uses the `ckpt_dir` in `ovi/configs/inference/inference_fusion.yaml` to initialize the model
```bash
python3 gradio_app.py

OR

# To enable cpu offload to save GPU VRAM, will slow down end to end inference by ~20 seconds
python3 gradio_app.py --cpu_offload

OR

# To enable an additional image generation model to generate first frames for I2V, cpu_offload is automatically enabled if image generation model is enabled
python3 gradio_app.py --use_image_gen

OR

# To run model with 24Gb GPU vram
python3 gradio_app.py --cpu_offload --fp8

```
